# Image Compression

-This project aims to use Single Valued Decomposition to Compress a given jpg file.
-Yup it's that simple.
-To use this you need to install MATLAB or OCTAVE first so do that.
-The build.bat file only works for windows. If you are not running windows kindly run the script normally (it should run  fine ,I guess).
-I was about to implement this whole thing using python and its nice little libraries but had to use MATLAB/OCTAVE for my uni project.
-Thanks :3
