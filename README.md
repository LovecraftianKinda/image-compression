# Image Compression

This project aims to use **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to compress a given **JPG** file.  
Yup, it's that simple.

## Requirements

-You need to install **MATLAB** or **Octave** firstâ€”so do that.
-The `build.bat` file **only works for Windows**.  
-If you are not running Windows, you can **run the script manually** (it should work fine, I guess).  

## Notes

I was about to implement this whole thing using **Python** and its nice little libraries,  
but I had to use **MATLAB/Octave** for my uni project.  

Also check out this awesome explanation on SVD and compression, I learned a lot from it : [Link Text](https://dmicz.github.io/machine-learning/svd-image-compression/)

Thanks! :3
